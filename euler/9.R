# Special Pythagorean triplet
# Problem 9 
# A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, 
# for which

# a^2 + b^2 = c^2
# For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.

# There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
# Find the product abc.

# Brute force: this is slow but it works
